Create an S3 bucket - we will use this for our Spark application code (which will be provided later) and the Spark application's results.  
Refer to the **Create a Bucket** page in the *["Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)*

You don't need to create a VPC, as the workshop account already has a default VPC that we will use in this workshop.
