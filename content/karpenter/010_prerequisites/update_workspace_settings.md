Please note: this EKS and Karpenter workshop version is now deprecated since the launch of Karpenter v1beta, and has been updated to a new home on AWS Workshop Studio here: **[Karpenter: Amazon EKS Best Practice and Cloud Cost Optimization](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f6b4587e-b8a5-4a43-be87-26bd85a70aba)**.

This workshop remains here for reference to those who have used this workshop before, or those who want to reference this workshop for running Karpenter on version v1alpha5.

**Note**: Cloud9 normally manages IAM credentials dynamically. This isnâ€™t currently compatible with the EKS IAM authentication, so we will disable it and rely on the IAM role instead. To do so, run the following commands in the Cloud9 workspace:
```
aws cloud9 update-environment --environment-id ${C9_PID} --managed-credentials-action DISABLE
rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials
```
