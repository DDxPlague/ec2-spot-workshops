**Congratulations!** you have reached the end of the workshop. We covered a lot of ground learning how to apply EC2 Spot best practices such as diversification, as 
well as the use of capacity providers.

In the session, we have:

- Deployed a CloudFormation Stack that prepared our environment, including our VPC and a Cloud9 environment.
- Created and configured an ECS cluster from the scratch.
- Created Auto Scaling Groups and Capacity Providers associated with them for OnDemand and Spot instances, and applied EC2 Spot Diversification srategies. 
- Configured a Capacity provider strategy that mixes OnDemand and Spot
- Learned how ECS Cluster Scaling works with Capacity Providers
- Deployed Services both on Fargate Capacity Providers and EC2 Capacity providers
