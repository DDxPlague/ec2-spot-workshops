## Overview 
Amazon EC2 Spot Instances are a good fit in DevOps scenarios: to run your CI/CD pipelines (including build and test runners) and to deploy your testing environments. In this section you can select one of the two workshops for CI/CD depending on the tool that you use:
* [Jenkins](/amazon-ec2-spot-cicd-workshop/jenkins-spot.html)
* [GitLab](/amazon-ec2-spot-cicd-workshop/gitlab-spot.html)
